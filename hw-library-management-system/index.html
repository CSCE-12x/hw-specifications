</ul>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In a quiet corner of town, there stands an old library with towering
shelves brimming with books. This library, known as <em>The Grand Book
Haven</em>, has been a sanctuary for book lovers for generations.
However, as the years go by, the library’s traditional methods of
cataloging and managing books have started to show their age. It is time
for a modern solution to keep up with the demands of eager readers and
loyal patrons.</p>
<p>We have been asked to build the new library management system,
designed to bring efficiency and organization to <em>The Grand Book
Haven</em>. At the heart of this system are three crucial components:
the <code>Book</code>, the <code>Member</code>, and the
<code>Library</code>. Each <code>Book</code> in the collection carries a
unique tale, from classic literature to contemporary masterpieces. With
attributes like <code>title</code>, <code>author</code>,
<code>ISBN</code>, and <code>availability</code>, tracking the
whereabouts of each book becomes a seamless process. No longer will a
book go missing, only to be discovered tucked away in a forgotten
corner.</p>
<p>The library’s cherished members, young and old, will find their place
in the system as well. Each <code>Member</code> will be registered with
their <code>name</code> and <code>ID</code>, allowing them to borrow and
return books with ease. The system should ensure that members can always
find the books they desire, and the library can keep track of which
books are borrowed by whom. It will foster a sense of responsibility and
community among the readers, as everyone plays a part in preserving the
library’s treasures.</p>
<p>With the new management system in place, the librarian will breathe a
sigh of relief. The <code>Library</code> class will tie everything
together, from adding new books to the collection to handling member
registrations. Borrowing and returning books should become a streamlined
process, and the library’s shelves will always be well-organized.
<em>The Grand Book Haven</em> will once again thrive as a beacon of
knowledge, inviting everyone to embark on literary adventures and
discover new worlds within the pages of their beloved books.</p>
<h3 id="guidelines-for-homework">Guidelines for Homework</h3>
<ul>
<li>This and all other homeworks are individual coding practice
assignments.</li>
<li>Do not show your code to other students.</li>
<li>Do not look at the code of other students.</li>
<li>Do not share your code with other students.</li>
<li>Do not use AI tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about this assignment, talk to a Peer Teacher,
a TA, or an instructor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Gradescope to submit your code</li>
<li>Ask questions on the Q&amp;A board.
<ul>
<li>Look there to see if someone has already asked your question.</li>
<li>It is very rare that a student’s question is unique. Ask there, and
everyone can benefit from the answer.</li>
<li>If you know the answer, go ahead and answer it yourself!</li>
<li>Do not post HW code publicly. Make a <strong>private</strong> post
to Instructors and TAs on the Q&amp;A board..
<ul>
<li>Do not post screenshots of code.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you know about another student who is sharing their code with
other students (or in any other way is violating the Aggie Code of
Honor), you should report them to the instructor or <a
href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?TexasAMUniv&amp;layout_id=11">report
them to the AHSO</a>. If you become aware of academic dishonesty, you
are expected to report it through the appropriate channels.</p>

<h3 id="test-data">Test Data</h3>
<p>To help with debugging, several text files are provided containing
test data.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>This is a guide on how to tackle doing this homework. Specific
requirements for functions are in the <a
href="#requirements">Requirements</a> section above.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NvIBepbm52xdAyXpNgUiqCxoKDv7-W-V/view?usp=drive_link">Get
the starter code and test files</a>
<ul>
<li>Code Files (<strong>only <code>.cpp</code>,</strong> except
<code>main.cpp</code><strong>,</strong> files must be submitted to
Gradescope)
<ul>
<li><strong><code>book.cpp</code></strong> <code>and book.h</code></li>
<li><strong><code>member.cpp</code></strong>
<code>and member.h</code></li>
<li><strong><code>library.cpp</code></strong>
<code>and library.h</code></li>
<li><strong><code>lms_utilities.cpp</code></strong>
<code>and lms_utilities.h</code></li>
<li><code>main.cpp</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Test Files
<ul>
<li>Various text files to help you test your code (.txt)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Review the code.
<ul>
<li>Compile and run it before making any changes.
<ul>
<li>It will compile without warnings or errors</li>
<li>It won’t do anything, but it also won’t crash.
<ul>
<li>So <strong>all</strong> errors were introduced by you! :smile:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read the files
<ul>
<li>Header files
<ul>
<li><strong>Read the header files!</strong> It gives details about each
function you will implement.</li>
<li>No changes are required</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Source files
<ul>
<li>The source files (<code>.cpp</code> files) have comments marked
<code>TODO(student)</code> where you will need to write your code.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement functions
<ul>
<li><strong>Write your code so that it is easy to understand!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Conventions like meaningful variable names and commenting will make
it easier for you to understand your own code and implement your
algorithms!
<ul>
<li>This also helps if you need to get help from a TA, Peer Teacher, or
instructor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use descriptive naming conventions for variables and functions.</li>
<li><strong>Add comments</strong> to the code to describe anything that
is not obvious from the code.</li>
<li>Use (indentation, blank lines) to visually organize code.</li>
<li>Use functions to reduce code duplication and increase
abstraction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write a little bit of code, test it, and debug it. Repeat until
finished.
<ul>
<li>Writing all of your code and then going back to debug can double,
triple, quadruple, or more the time it takes you to implement your
solution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You should attempt to implement functions based on their
dependencies.</li>
<li>Recompile and rerun after completing each function.
<ul>
<li>Note: You can test and debug before you add all functionality to a
function. Get one aspect to work and then add functionality in
increments until you complete the full functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check for errors.</li>
<li>If no errors, move on</li>
<li>Else, start debugging</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once you have some functionality, submit to Gradescope.
<ul>
<li>If the basic tests for that function pass, move on</li>
<li>Else, start debugging</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Continue by picking new tests and writing just enough code to pass
them, adding more functionality each time.</li>
