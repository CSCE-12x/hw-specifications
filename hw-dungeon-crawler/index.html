<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create and store values in a 2D vector.</li>
<li>Resize a 2D vector.</li>
<li>Rely on <code>std::vector</code> for automatic memory
management</li>
<li>Use pass by reference.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>You have just been hired by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar">Foobar</a> Games as a game
logic programmer. The company is working on a retro dungeon crawler,
which is a type of game where you control a character who is navigating
a fantasy dungeon environment.</p>
<p>You are in charge of <strong>implementing</strong> and testing part
of the core game logic. The art and design teams are still working on
graphics and sound, so you are working on a text-based prototype for
developing and debugging your logic code.</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will <strong>implement</strong> the code that
reads an in-game map (or “dungeon”) from a file into a dynamic 2D vector
. You must also <strong>implement</strong> updating the map as the
player moves the character through the dungeon. The player’s goal is to
pick up the treasure and go to the level’s exit. Additionally, you will
need to <strong>implement</strong> magic amulets that resize the dungeon
size as well as <strong>implement</strong> the logic for the monsters
that chase the player.</p>

upward, check each individual tile to see if there is a monster on the
tile.</li>
<li>If there is a monster on a tile, move the monster one tile closer to
the adventurer.</li>
<li>Continue to check until you have reached the top of the map or reach
a pillar (monsters can’t see through pillars)</li>
<li>Repeat the same logic with down, left, and right (in that order).
Make sure all monsters that are supposed to move do so before you go to
the next step.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Return true if a monster reaches the player, false otherwise.
<ul>
<li>The adventurer is killed if a monster moves onto their tile (check
if the player position now contains a monster), return true (adventurer
killed, game over) if so, otherwise return false (the monsters did not
attack the adventurer, yet…).</li>

<hr />
<h3 id="a-testing-your-code">A: Testing Your Code</h3>
<h4 id="sample-dungeons">Sample Dungeons</h4>
<p>Included in the starter code from Canvas is a folder of sample
dungeon levels. You will find the 4 <code>tutorial</code> levels, 2
levels for the “<code>easy</code>” dungeon, and 3 levels for the
“<code>hard</code>” dungeon.</p>
<p><a href="#b-input-map-text-file">See Appendix B for more information
about playing the game</a>. As an example, to play the hard dungeon, you
would enter “<code>levels/hard 3</code>” at the beginning prompt. You
may want to test with the <code>tutorial</code> or <code>easy</code>
dungeon. The hard dungeon is not for the faint of heart! Can you escape
it?</p>
<p>Of course, feel free to create your own levels! <a
href="#a-testing-your-code">Review Appendix A for information about the
level file structure.</a></p>
<h4 id="debug-printouts">Debug Printouts</h4>
<p>Because we want to only print out the map with each action, you will
need to remove the debugging output from your code before submitting for
the full program test cases. The full program cases do not include any
debugging output, so <strong>Gradescope will not allow them to pass if
extraneous (e.g. debug) output is present.</strong></p>
<h4 id="test-cases">Test Cases</h4>
<p>In addition to the extensive unit tests that you considered
(i.e. inputs and expected results), Gradescope also has unit tests
associated with each function. There are also full system tests which
check the integration of your code into the existing gameplay loop (in
dungeoncrawler.cpp).</p>
<p>However, you should remember that you are responsible for correctly
implementing the game logic and testing your code, so some test cases
may not have thorough coverage of every possible edge case. Try to think
of edge cases and test them out yourself while developing!</p>
<p>Note that video games can be particularly challenging to find all
bugs through <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven
development</a>. Games rely extensively on user interaction, so it is
possible for a nearly-infinite combination of edge cases to exist. The
gaming industry has helped popularize play-testing jobs and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Beta_testing">beta
software</a> releases as one means of identifying bugs during
development.</p>
<h4 id="more-ideas">More Ideas</h4>
<p>After you have finished and earned a score on Gradescope with which
you are satisfied, here are some other game mechanics you can think
about implementing. You won’t get extra credit for these, but if you
have some free time you might find them both enjoyable and good
practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Monsters with different behaviors, for example up/down or left/right
every turn, diagonally, two or more squares per turn, etc.
<ul>
<li>Note: Most of what we have done so far in this course has been
procedural, but as you learn more about object-oriented approaches,
think about how we could do more complicated monster behaviors. You
could keep a list of monster objects, each with their own location,
actions, etc. that you update each turn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Doors that require different amounts of treasure to unlock, or let
you go back to a previous level.</li>
<li>Nonlinear dungeons, where levels have multiple doors to different
levels.</li>
<li>Levels that shrink each turn, like a trash compactor.</li>
<li>More items with different properties, for example a shield to
protect you against monsters, a sword to let you attack monsters, a
potion that lets you move faster or freeze monsters, bombs that blow up
pillars, etc.</li>
<li>The ability to restart a level if the adventurer is killed.</li>
<li>Update the map on the console without reprinting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though this is a very rudimentary game, we hope you can imagine
how this assignment relates to modern computer games. With some
graphics, music and sound effects, and a little polish, you’ve built the
basics of a turn-based dungeon crawler!</p>
<h3 id="b-input-map-text-file">B: Input Map Text File</h3>
<p>This assignment will involve reading a text file that contains
information of the dungeon map’s internal representation. This text file
consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1: Map Dimensions. This line contains two values for
representing the map’s number of rows and number of columns,
respectively. (Neither can be bigger than 999,999)</li>
<li>Line 2: Player Starting Location. This line contains two values for
representing the player’s starting row and column, respectively.</li>
<li>Lines 3+: These lines contain the individual tile information of the
dungeon map as char values.
<ul>
<li>The first number in Line 3 represents the map tile at (0, 0), where
the first value is the row position and the second value is the column
position.</li>
<li>Refer to the tile status constants in logic.h for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The following is an example text file for a 5×3 tile representation
of a dungeon map.</p>
<pre><code>5 3
3 0
M + -
- + -
- + !
- - -
@ - $</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Line 1: The map has 5 rows and 3 columns.</li>
<li>Line 2: The player will start at map location (3, 0), where 3 is the
row position and 0 is the column position. Remember that indexing starts
from 0, so the top left corner will be map location (0, 0). The player
can only be placed on an open spot.</li>
<li>Lines 3-7: The map’s internal representation for each map tile.
<ul>
<li><strong>Note #1:</strong> Whitespace for lines 3 and after are
purely for aesthetic purposes, so you must not assume that line breaks
represent the actual map dimensions or that there will be spaces in
between the char values.</li>
<li><strong>Note #2:</strong> In this assignment you will be using
row-major ordering when working with your 2D vectors , as this is how a
C++ program will typically order a 2D vector.</li>
<li><strong>Note #3:</strong> Each level of a dungeon has its own map
stored in a different file, each named according to the dungeon name
followed by the level number. For example, if the dungeon is named
“<code>tutorial</code>” and has four levels, the files will be
“<code>tutorial1.txt</code>”, “<code>tutorial2.txt</code>”,
“<code>tutorial3.txt</code>”, and “<code>tutorial4.txt</code>”.</li>
<li><strong>Note #4:</strong> Only the final level will have an exit (an
<strong>!</strong> symbol); all the other levels have doors (a
<strong>?</strong> symbol) to the next level.
<ul>
<li>It is possible for a “final level” to have both an exit and a door
(for example, a “secret” level).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-gameplay">C: Gameplay</h3>
<p>These are sketches and descriptions from the design team of the
expected gameplay that you must implement and test.</p>
<h4 id="loading-a-game">Loading a Game</h4>
<p>Each game starts with a printout of the instructions, followed by a
prompt for the dungeon name and the number of levels in the dungeon.
Here our dungeon is called tutorial and it has 4 levels (user input in

following <a href="./loading_game.png">screenshot</a>.</p>
<h4 id="navigating-the-dungeon">Navigating the Dungeon</h4>
<p>Our dungeon crawler uses the WASD method of controlling the in-game
adventurer: <strong>w</strong> and <strong>s</strong> move the
adventurer up one row and down one row respectively, while
<strong>a</strong> and <strong>d</strong> move the adventurer left one
column and right one column respectively. Entering <strong>e</strong>
will cause the adventurer to stay still for a turn.</p>
<p>Tiles with unpassable obstacles (a pillar) cannot be moved onto, and
are represented by the <strong>+</strong> symbol. The door to the next
level is represented by the <strong>?</strong> symbol, while the door
out of the dungeon (and thus the game) is represented by the
<strong>!</strong> symbol.</p>

<h4 id="treasure">Treasure</h4>
<p>Dungeons are dangerous places, so why would you put up with all that
risk for no reward? Tiles with treasure on them are represented by the
<strong>$</strong> symbol. Pick up a piece of treasure by moving the
adventurer to that tile.</p>
<p>Upon exiting, the game will tell you how much treasure was picked up
by the adventurer across all levels. But make sure you don’t leave
empty-handed, since the door out of the dungeon (represented by the
<strong>!</strong> symbol) won’t open if you don’t have at least one
piece of treasure!</p>

<h4 id="monsters">Monsters</h4>
<p>So, what makes dungeons so dangerous anyway? The monsters kept in
them to guard the treasure of course! Monsters are represented by the
symbol <strong>M</strong>, and will chase any adventurer in their line
of sight (i.e., if the adventurer is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rook_%28chess%29">rook</a>’s move
from them). Thankfully, they are slow and move only one tile per turn,
and cannot see over unpassable obstacles, allowing the adventurer to
hide behind them.</p>
<p>The adventurer is quick enough that he can get through a door before
a monster attacks on the next turn, but won’t be able to pick up an item
and then withstand an attack. Monster attacks are lethal, and being
killed by the monster will cause you to lose the game. The adventurer is
not strong enough to attack a monster, so the only strategy is to run
away. Monsters are powerful, and will destroy any (passable) obstacle in
their path - including treasure, amulets, doors, and even other
monsters! Make sure that the monsters don’t destroy the only way
out…</p>

<h4 id="magic-amulets">Magic Amulets</h4>
<p>The dungeon also holds many ancient and mysterious artifacts, such as
magic amulets. Magic amulets are represented by the @ symbol. Picking up
an amulet will cause the level to double in size, with three additional
copies of the level (without additional adventurers, but with additional
monsters and items) appearing below, to the right, and diagonally below
and right of the level. Unfortunately, the amulet is destroyed in the
process and isn’t copied as well.</p>
<p>Be careful, magic can be dangerous to use - make sure you don’t
accidentally have a monster appear right next to you! But in wise hands,
magic can help you escape from otherwise impossible levels…</p>
